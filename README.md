 > As you complete each section you **must** remove the prompt text. Every *turnin* of this project includes points for formatting of this README so keep it clean and keep it up to date. 
 > Prompt text is any lines beginning with "\>"
 > Replace anything between \<...\> with your project specifics and remove angle brackets. For example, you need to name your project and replace the header right below this line with that title (no angle brackets). 
Untitled Pokemon-like RPG
 > Your author list below should include links to all members GitHub (remove existing author).

 > ## Expectations
 > * The backend of your project should be implemented in C++. If you wish to choose anoher programming language (e.g. Java, Python), please discuss with your lab TA to obtain permission.
 > * You can incorporate additional technologies/tools but they must be approved (in writing) by the instructor or the TA.
 > * Each member of the group **must** be committing code regularly and make sure their code is correctly attributed to them. We will be checking attributions to determine if there was equal contribution to the project.
 > * **Each member of the group must actively participate in the Github Project board, writing unit tests, and reviewing commited code.**
> * All project phases are to be submitted to this GitHub repository. You should modify this README file to reflect the different phases of the project. In addition, you should regularly hold sprint meetings with your group. You will need to hold two to three scrum/check-in meetings with your lab TA/reader at different times in addition to the final demo.

## Project Description
 > Your project description should summarize the project you are proposing. Be sure to include:
 > * Why is it important or interesting to you?
 We all enjoy RPG games, and we wanted to make something Pokemon-inspired and fun since we all grew up with the series.
 > * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)
 We are planning only to use C++.
 > * What will be the input/output of your project?
 Input will be text or characters and output will be text on the command line.
 > * What are the features that the project provides?
 Features include...
 -A short, linear story
 -Type advantages similar to Pokemon (water is strong against fire, etc.)
 -5 different monsters to collect, train, and battle with
 > This description should be in enough detail that the TA/instructor can determine the complexity of the project and if it is sufficient for the team members to complete in the time allotted. 
 > 
 > You also need to set up an empty project board using GitHub projects (board view). Make sure you add the board under your project repository. You should also have a Product Backlog and In testing columns added.
 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "Class Diagram" section below, you will need to:
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature. Place these epics in the `Product Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Break down the "Epics" into smaller actionable user stories (i.e. smaller development tasks). Convert them into issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team. Then, once the sprint is over you should be repeating these steps to plan a new sprint, taking you until your second scrum meeting with the reader in phase III.
 > * Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. You need to pick both time slots during your lab on week 6. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
 >   * The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
 >   * The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
 >     * The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
 >     * How work will be divided between the team members
## Class Diagram
 > Include a **class diagram(s)** for your project and a **description** of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper UML notation (as discussed in the course slides).
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase I.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
> 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
